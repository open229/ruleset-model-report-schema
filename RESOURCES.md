# Resources for RPD Generator Developers

The current page contains a collection of resources for developers of RPD generation tools. 

The [first public review](https://osr.ashrae.org/Online-Comment-Database/ShowDoc2/Table/DocumentAttachments/FileName/4308-Std229P_1st_PPR_Draft_chair_approved.zip/download/false) is runing from April 5, 2024 to June 4, 2024. It is unlikely to be avaialble after that time.

The document includes many different links to other resources including:

## Example RPD Generator Implementations

The following is a list of software that generated RPD files:

[EnergyPlus createRulesetProjectDescription](https://github.com/JasonGlazer/createRulesetProjectDescription) - open source

More are expected to be added in the future.

## Example Ruleset Checking Tool Implementations

So far the only know Ruleset Checking Tool (RCT) under development is:

[PNNL Ruleset Checking Tool](https://github.com/pnnl/ruleset-checking-tool) - open source

This includes:

[Example RPD files](https://github.com/pnnl/ruleset-checking-tool/tree/master/examples/chicago_demo)

## Schema Videos

The following videos were prepared to help SPC 229 on letter ballot votes on various data groups. They are from 8 to 18 minutes and each usually covers several related data groups. They do not cover the entire schema but only selected data groups. Some data element names and Notes have been updated since the time of the video so please always check the [schema source](https://github.com/open229/ruleset-model-description-schema/tree/develop/schema-source) or [docs](https://github.com/open229/ruleset-model-description-schema/tree/develop/docs229) for the latest version.
